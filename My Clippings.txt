important. However, it’s not just as easy as knowing you have to do it and thus doing it. There are powerful reasons we don’t finish what we start and follow through very often. These reasons can generally be split into two camps: inhibiting tactics and psychological roadblocks. Inhibiting tactics are the ways we plan against ourselves without even realizing it. They include (1) setting bad goals, (2) procrastination, (3) indulging in temptations and distractions, and (4) poor time management. Psychological roadblocks are the ways we don’t follow through because we are unconsciously protecting ourselves. These include (1) laziness and lack of discipline, (2) fear of judgment, rejection, and failure, (3) perfectionism out of insecurity, and (4) lack of self-awareness.

motivators you have at your disposal—a task that is rarely performed. External motivators are when we leverage other people, places, and things to push us into action. For the most part, these are when we want to avoid negative consequences involving other people, places, and things. These methods include accountability partners and groups, putting money down upfront, and self-bribery. Internal motivators are when we look at how we stand to benefit and improve our lives. These are universal needs, drives, and desires that are easy to lose track of. The easy way to find these is to answer a set of questions that directly asks things such as how am I going to benefit from this and how does my life stand to improve from this?

deal with this mental obstacle by playing with the cost-benefit ratio so the cost is minimized or the benefit is maximized. Motivation has been shown to work best when we are reminded of it—otherwise, out of sight, out of mind. Thus, you should have cues you’re your motivations all around you—but make sure to keep them distinct and memorable, use all five senses (even taste), and make sure to change and switch them periodically to avoid growing used to them and forgetting them.

These keep you within the bounds of what you know you need to do. These are also the building blocks of good habits. Rule 4: Sometimes we lose sight of what we want to accomplish. Thus, reaffirm your intentions by stating “I want,” “I will,” and “I won’t” statements. Rule 5: Try to look into the future, 10 minutes, hours, and days at a time. Do you like what you see when you consider not following through? Is it worth the benefit to the current self at the expense of the future self? Probably not. Rule 6: It’s just 10 minutes, right? So if you want to quit, it’s just 10 minutes. And if you need to wait, it’s just 10 minutes.

attempt to embody. Mindset 1: It’s all worthwhile. If you feel that your hard work will get you somewhere, you belong and are as good as anyone else, and you feel impact toward your overall goals, execution is easier to stick with. Mindset 2: Become comfortable with discomfort. Everything you want to do will have elements of discomfort, unless you just want to watch television all day by yourself. Thus, becoming used to this feeling allows you to tackle what you want without fear. Mindset 3: Without following through, there is no learning. Only when you finish something can you evaluate yourself and correct your errors. Embody an information-gathering mindset. Mindset 4: The detrimental power of stress and anxiety can’t be overstated. Even being in a poor mood is dangerous to your productivity and follow-through. Be aware and take proactive measures to modulate your stress levels.

Chapter 5: The Science of Smashing Procrastination Tackling procrastination is similar to pushing Sisyphus’s stone. You can beat it back for a bit, but it’s so natural that you will never be fully rid of it. The problem is typified by time inconsistency, where we comprise two selves that don’t have overlapping desires—one wants gratification in the future and the other wants it right now. Temptation bundling is an effective method to battle procrastination. It consists of combining your unpleasurable tasks with something pleasurable. This mainly works because you are battling time inconsistency and giving both selves what they want simultaneously. Start easy and small. Procrastination thrives off inertia. Therefore, you need to make the path to motion and action as easy as possible. Then eventually you can gain momentum—the opposite of inertia. Sometimes beating procrastination just requires a kick in the pants. Fear and productive paranoia can do that to you—if you are so fearful of the negative repercussions you will face,

Chapter 6. No Distraction Zone   Minimize your distractions in your environment. It turns out that out of sight is out of mind with distractions, so don’t keep anything stimulating near your workstation otherwise your willpower will slowly deplete itself. Create default actions wherever possible. This is where the easiest and lowest resistance past for you is the path you want the most. This is also done through curating and designing your environment for productivity. Singletasking is an important concept because it definitively proves the flaws of multitasking. When you switch from task to task, you create attention residue. This means it takes a while for you to adjust to each new task, even if you were already familiar with it. You can eliminate this by singletasking, and also by batching, which is when you do all similar types of tasks together to capitalize on your mental efficiency. A don’t-do list can be just as powerful

Include tasks you can’t move forward on, make progress on, or help. The 40–70 rule is when you beat inaction through the amount of information you seek. If you have less than 40%, don’t act. But if you have 70%, you must act. You’ll never have 100%, and chances are, 70% is more than sufficient—the rest you learn along the way, anyway. Finally, you might want to do nothing from time to time. This is rest and relaxation—but you should think of it as mental recovery. What does an athlete do between races or matches? You got it—they recover so they are primed to work again when necessary.

expect that you will be able to change or improve to an unrealistic degree. When you inevitably fail to meet this mark, there is a very real backlash that results in you being even less motivated and disciplined than before you started. To beat this, set proper expectations based on your history and understand the difference between goals and expectations. Overthinking is sneaky because it feels like action and it even feels productive. But it’s not. Overthinking is when you fixate and can’t seem to take the first step toward action. Zero in on the details that matter, deliberately ignore everything else, and you’ll feel much more clarity. Worrying is when you fixate on something and inevitably start drawing out the negative scenarios and pitfalls. However, worrying is also when you fixate on things you can’t control while ignoring what you can control—the present. The solution is to focus on what you can do right now and only right now. Do you know yourself? Well, what about in terms of productivity and how you work and produce the best?

Chapter 8. Daily Systems for Success   Systems are sets of daily behaviors. It doesn’t have to be more complex than that. Systems stand in stark contrast to goals because goals are one-off accomplishments, while systems emphasize consistency and long-term success. Keep a scoreboard for everything large and trivial. This keeps you motivated and striving toward growth and progress. Manage your time better by understanding how long things will take in reality and accounting for your own quirks and inefficiencies.

Blockchains create permanent records and histories of transactions, but nothing is really permanent. The permanence of the record is based on the permanence of the network. In the context of blockchains, this means that a large portion of a blockchain community would all have to agree to change the information and are incentivized not to change the data.

» Public networks are large and decentralized, anyone can participate within them at any level — this includes things like running a full node, mining cryptocurrency, trading tokens, or publishing entries. They tend to be more secure and immutable then private or permissioned networks. They’re often slower and more expensive to use. They’re are secured with a cryptocurrency and have limited storage capacity.

» Private networks are shared between trusted parties and may not be viewable to the public. They’re very fast and may have no latency. They also have a low cost to run and can be built in an industrious weekend. Most private networks do not utilize a cryptocurrency and do not have the same immutability and security of decentralized networks. Storage capacity may be unlimited.

Blockchains are very powerful tools and are positioned to change how the world moves money, secures systems, and builds digital identities. If you aren’t a core developer, you probably won’t be doing any in-depth block- chain development in the near future. That said, you still need to understand how blockchains work and what their core limitations are, because they’ll be integrated into many everyday online interactions — from how businesses pay people to how governments know that their systems and data are intact and secure.

When you create a DAO, you can invite others to participate in the gov- ernance of the organization. The participants can remain anonymous and never meet, which could trigger Know Your Customer (KYC) rules (the process a busi- ness must go through to verifying the identity of its clients) and anti-money laundering (AML; the laws and regulations designed to stop the practice of generating income through illegal means) compliance issues.

Unlike most traditional investment vehicles, where a central party makes deci- sions about investments, the members of a DAO control 100 percent of the assets. They vote on new investments and other decisions. This type of structure threat- ens to displace traditional financial managers. DAOs are built with code that can’t be changed on the fly. The appeal of this is that malicious hackers can’t monkey with the funds in a traditional sense.

I go to a bar and the man at the door stops me and asks to see my ID. I reach into my wallet and hand him my driver’s license. My license has a lot of information on it that the bouncer doesn’t need, nor should he have access to (like my address). All he needs from the ID is that I’m over the age of 21. He doesn’t even need to know how old I am — just that I meet the regulation requirements.

The blockchain micro insurance principle is simple and consists of four steps: 1. Lending/insuring agreement proposal A person can offer to lend his property through his insurance provider, if the property is digitally registered. The offer can be sent to the potential user, either through the insurance company channels or via a public platform such as Facebook.

2. Agreement review The borrower can then review the proposal that he received and accept or decline it. The offer is kept in the public records, and if the borrower accepts the proposal, he can purchase the insurance through standard payment channels, and the process moves to the third step.

3. Agreement signature and notarization If both parties are on the same page, the insurance is paid for and the borrower receives the property in question, the agreement is digitally signed and nota- rized onto a blockchain. This makes it virtually tamper-proof. All the transaction information is safely stored with a clear audit trail if it’s ever needed.

Three main mechanisms appear to cause gluten to assault the nervous system. The first is related to cross-reactivity, a concept in immunology in which the immune system mistakes one protein for another—it appears the protein structure of gluten is similar to protein structures in the nervous system. When you are sensitive to gluten the immune system produces gluten antibodies to tag it for destruction. However, because gluten is similar in structure to nervous tissue, the immune system may accidentally produce antibodies to nervous tissue whenever you eat gluten. In this case, a gluten sensitivity may create an autoimmune attack against the brain or other parts of the nervous system thanks to cross-reactivity.

The third mechanism is that immune reactions to gluten can break down the blood-brain barrier, the thin lining that protects the brain, and lead to what is called “leaky brain.” A healthy blood-brain barrier prevents pathogens from getting into the brain but allows in necessary compounds, such as precursors for neurotransmitters. A leaky brain can allow in pathogens that increase the risk of autoimmune reactions in the brain and nervous system.39 40 I describe this more in Chapter Nine.

Gut-brain axis basics Let’s start with the basics of how everything works. Your brain constantly receives messages called “presynaptic inputs” and it constantly sends messages called “postsynaptic outputs.” These inputs include visual stimulation from your eyes, touch sensation from your skin, sound from your ears, gravitational input to your joints and muscles, tastes from your tongue, and smells from your nose. These presynaptic inputs activate your brain, causing neurons to fire. The constant stimulation of neurons keeps them healthy and strong, just as physical exercise keeps your muscles healthy and strong. Your brain processes these presynaptic inputs and then sends messages to various parts of your nervous system, which is called “postsynaptic excitation.”

Many people have heard we only use 10 percent of our brains but this is not true. We use 100 percent of our brains. The rumor is a misinterpretation of the fact that we use only 10 percent of our brain for voluntary control. The other 90 percent of our brain directs the non-voluntary autonomic function used to breath, control blood circulation, control our heart, and digest our food. Therefore, we use 100 percent of our brain and every nerve cell counts if we want to maintain our health.

The brain activates the brainstem, the brainstem activates the vagus nerve, and the vagus nerve stimulates the enteric nervous system. The enteric nervous system then stimulates intestinal muscles to move food along, also known as motility.5

Leaky gut happens when these tight junctions weaken and allow large, improperly digested proteins, bacteria, fungus, and other pathogens to cross the intestinal wall. As these proteins pass through the leaky gut they inflame the intestinal wall and cause a buildup of mucus.

Also, because pathogens don’t belong in the bloodstream they alert the immune system to attack and destroy. When a person has leaky gut this immune activation is constant, which may lead to inflammation causing pain, food sensitivities, rashes, brain health issues, and other imbalances. Because inflammation contributes to leaky gut, it becomes a self-perpetuating vicious cycle between the two.9

When the digestive tract becomes inflamed, the normally tight junctions weaken and allow undigested foods, toxins, and bacteria into the bloodstream. As these compounds pass through the tight junctions they trigger the intestinal immune system, releasing inflammatory cytokines, or immune messenger cells. These cytokines make their way into the bloodstream, where they cause inflammation throughout the body (systemic inflammation), including in the brain, joints, heart, skin, blood vessels, and other tissues.

"childlike" is used in describing the Child (an archaic ego state), since it is more biological and not prejudicial. Actually the Child is in many ways the most valuable part of the personality, and can contribute to the individual's life exactly what an actual child can contribute to family life: charm, pleasure and creativity. If the Child in the individual is confused and unhealthy, then the consequences may be unfortunate, but something can and should be done about it.

2. The same applies to the words "mature" and "immature." In this system there is no such thing as an "immature person." There are only people in whom the Child takes over inappropriately or unproductively, but all such people have a complete, well-structured Adult which only needs to be uncovered or activated. Conversely, so-called "mature people" are people who are able to keep the Adult in control most of the time, but their Child will take over on occasion like anyone else's, often with disconcerting results. 3. It should be noted that the Parent is exhibited in two forms, direct and indirect: as an active ego state, and as an influence. When it is directly active, the person responds as his own father (or mother) actually responded ("Do as I do"). When it is an indirect influence, he responds the way they wanted him to respond ("Don't do as I do, do as I say"). In the first case

4. Thus the Child is also exhibited in two forms: the adapted Child and the natural Child. The adapted Child is the one who modifies his behavior under the Parental influence. He behaves as father (or mother) wanted him to behave: compliantly or precociously, for example. Or he adapts himself by withdrawing or whining. Thus the Parental influence is a cause, and the adapted Child an effect. The natural Child is a spontaneous expression: rebellion or creativity, for example. A confirmation of structural analysis is seen in the results of alcohol intoxication. Usually this decommissions the Parent first, so that the adapted Child is freed of the Parental influence, and is transformed by release into the natural Child.

Think about how Google talks about its business. It certainly doesn’t claim to be a monopoly. But is it one? Well, it depends: a monopoly in what? Let’s say that Google is primarily a search engine. As of May 2014, it owns about 68% of the search market. (Its closest competitors, Microsoft and Yahoo!, have about 19% and 10%, respectively.) If that doesn’t seem dominant enough, consider the fact that the word “google” is now an official entry in the Oxford English Dictionary—as a verb. Don’t hold your breath waiting for that to happen to Bing. But suppose we say that Google is primarily an advertising company. That changes things. The U.S. search engine advertising market is $17 billion annually. Online advertising is $37 billion annually. The entire U.S. advertising market is $150 billion. And global advertising is a $495 billion market. So even if Google

Suppose you want to start a restaurant that serves British food in Palo Alto. “No one else is doing it,” you might reason. “We’ll own the entire market.” But that’s only true if the relevant market is the market for British food specifically. What if the actual market is the Palo Alto restaurant market in general? And what if all the restaurants in nearby towns are part of the relevant market as well?

These are hard questions, but the bigger problem is that you have an incentive not to ask them at all. When you hear that most new restaurants fail within one or two years, your instinct will be to come up with a story about how yours is different. You’ll spend time trying to convince people that you are exceptional instead of seriously considering whether that’s true. It would be better to pause and consider whether there are people in Palo Alto who would rather eat British food above all else. It’s very possible they don’t exist.

The problem with a competitive business goes beyond lack of profits. Imagine you’re running one of those restaurants in Mountain View. You’re not that different from dozens of your competitors, so you’ve got to fight hard to survive. If you offer affordable food with low margins, you can probably pay employees only minimum wage. And you’ll need to squeeze out every efficiency: that’s why small restaurants put Grandma to work at the register and make the kids wash dishes in the back.

The clearest way to make a 10x improvement is to invent something completely new. If you build something valuable where there was nothing before, the increase in value is theoretically infinite. A drug to safely eliminate the need for sleep, or a cure for baldness, for example, would certainly support a monopoly business. Or you can radically improve an existing solution: once you’re 10x better, you escape competition.

A startup is the largest endeavor over which you can have definite mastery. You can have agency not just over your own life, but over a small and important part of the world. It begins by rejecting the unjust tyranny of Chance.

The error lies in expecting that venture returns will be normally distributed: that is, bad companies will fail, mediocre ones will stay flat, and good ones will return 2x or even 4x. Assuming this bland pattern, investors assemble a diversified portfolio and hope that winners counterbalance losers. But this “spray and pray” approach usually produces an entire portfolio of flops, with no hits at all. This is because venture returns don’t follow a normal distribution overall. Rather, they follow a power law: a small handful of companies radically outperform all others.

Our results at Founders Fund illustrate this skewed pattern: Facebook, the best investment in our 2005 fund, returned more than all the others combined. Palantir, the second-best investment, is set to return more than the sum of every other investment aside from Facebook. This highly uneven pattern is not unusual: we see it in all our other funds as well. The biggest secret in venture capital is that the best investment in a successful fund equals or outperforms the entire rest of the fund combined.

Andreessen Horowitz invested $250,000 in Instagram in 2010. When Facebook bought Instagram just two years later for $1 billion, Andreessen netted $78 million—a 312x return in less than two years. That’s a phenomenal return, befitting the firm’s reputation as one of the Valley’s best. But in a weird way it’s not nearly enough, because Andreessen Horowitz has a $1.5 billion fund: if they only wrote $250,000 checks, they would need to find 19 Instagrams just to break even. This is why investors typically put a lot more money into any company worth funding. (And to be fair, Andreessen would have invested more in Instagram’s later rounds had it not been conflicted out by a previous investment.)

Every university believes in “excellence,” and hundred-page course catalogs arranged alphabetically according to arbitrary departments of knowledge seem designed to reassure you that “it doesn’t matter what you do, as long as you do it well.” That is completely false.

If we already understand as much of the natural world as we ever will—if all of today’s conventional ideas are already enlightened, and if everything has already been done—then there are no good answers. Contrarian thinking doesn’t make any sense unless the world still has secrets left to give up.

This is the classic trichotomy of the easy, the hard, and the impossible. Kaczynski argued that modern people are depressed because all the world’s hard problems have already been solved.

First is incrementalism. From an early age, we are taught that the right way to do things is to proceed one very small step at a time, day by day, grade by grade. If you overachieve and end up learning something that’s not on the test, you won’t receive credit for it. But in exchange for doing exactly what’s asked of you (and for doing it just a bit better than your peers), you’ll get an A.

secret hasn’t been vetted by the mainstream. If your goal is to never make a mistake in your life, you shouldn’t look for secrets.

Sometimes looking for natural secrets and looking for human secrets lead to the same truth. Consider the monopoly secret again: competition and capitalism are opposites. If you didn’t already know it, you could discover it the natural, empirical way: do a quantitative study of corporate profits and you’ll see they’re eliminated by competition. But you could also take the human approach and ask: what are people running companies not allowed to say? You would notice that monopolists downplay their monopoly status to avoid scrutiny, while competitive firms strategically exaggerate their uniqueness. The differences between firms only seem small on the surface; in fact, they are enormous.

In theory, this division works smoothly. Financial upside from part ownership attracts and rewards investors and workers. Effective possession motivates and empowers founders and employees—it means they can get stuff done. Oversight from the board places managers’ plans in a broader perspective. In practice, distributing these functions among different people makes sense, but it also multiplies opportunities for misalignment.

value for all shareholders far in the future. Unlike corporate giants, early-stage startups are small enough that founders usually have both ownership and possession. Most conflicts in a startup erupt between ownership and control—that is, between founders and investors on the board. The potential for conflict increases over time as interests diverge: a board member might want to take a company public as soon as possible to score a win for his venture firm, while the founders would prefer to stay private and grow the business.

That’s why hiring consultants doesn’t work. Part-time employees don’t work. Even working remotely should be avoided, because misalignment can creep in whenever colleagues aren’t together full-time, in the same place, every day.

However, for equity to create commitment rather than conflict, you must allocate it very carefully. Giving everyone equal shares is usually a mistake: every individual has different talents and responsibilities as well as different opportunity costs, so equal amounts will seem arbitrary and unfair from the start.

what would the ideal company culture look like? Employees should love their work. They should enjoy going to the office so much that formal business hours become obsolete and nobody watches the clock. The workspace should be open, not cubicled, and workers should feel at home: beanbag chairs and Ping-Pong tables might outnumber file cabinets. Free massages, on-site sushi chefs, and maybe even yoga classes would sweeten the scene. Pets should be welcome, too: perhaps employees’ dogs and cats could come and join the office’s tankful of tropical fish as unofficial company mascots.

So we set out to hire people who would actually enjoy working together. They had to be talented, but even more than that they had to be excited about working specifically with us. That was the start of the PayPal Mafia.

a normal person can’t be both rich and poor at the same time, for instance. But it happens all the time to founders: startup CEOs can be cash poor but millionaires on paper. They may oscillate between sullen jerkiness and appealing charisma. Almost all successful entrepreneurs are simultaneously insiders and outsiders. And when they do succeed, they attract both fame and infamy. When you plot them out, founders’ traits appear to follow an inverse normal distribution:

THAT AUGUST NIGHT over Afghanistan, Johnny Bravo risked his life so that others might survive. He received no performance bonus. He didn’t get a promotion or an award at the company off-site. He wasn’t looking for any undue attention or reality TV show for his efforts. For Johnny Bravo, it was just part of the “J.O.B.” as he puts it. And the greatest reward he received for his service was meeting the forces for whom he provided top cover that night. Though they had never met before, when they finally did meet, they hugged like old friends. In the linear hierarchies in which we work, we want the folks at the top to see what we did. We raise our hands for recognition and reward. For most of us, the more recognition we get for our efforts from those in charge, the more successful we think we are. It is a system that works so long as that one person who supervises us stays at the company and feels no undue pressure from above—a nearly impossible standard to maintain. For Johnny Bravo and those like him, the will to succeed and the desire to do things that advance the interests of the organization aren’t just motivated by recognition from above; they are integral to a culture of sacrifice and service, in which protection comes from all levels of the organization. There is one thing that Johnny Bravo credits for giving him the courage to cross into the darkness of the unknown, sometimes

Here, we are setting out to do something. We have a goal, a calling, a new beginning. Every great journey begins here—yet far too many of us never reach our intended destination. Ego more often than not is the culprit. We build ourselves up with fantastical stories, we pretend we have it all figured out, we let our star burn bright and hot only to fizzle out, and we have no idea why. These are symptoms of ego, for which humility and reality are the cure.

Almost universally, the kind of performance we give on social media is positive. It’s more “Let me tell you how well things are going. Look how great I am.” It’s rarely the truth: “I’m scared.

It is almost as if we are assaulted by silence or confronted by it, particularly if we’ve allowed our ego to lie to us over the years. Which is so damaging for one reason: the greatest work and art comes from wrestling with the void, facing it instead of scrambling to make it go away. The question is, when faced with your particular challenge—whether it is researching in a new field, starting a business, producing a film, securing a mentor, advancing an important cause—do you seek the respite of talk or do you face the struggle head-on?

It’s easy to be bitter, like Martial. To hate even the thought of subservience. To despise those who have more means, more experience, or more status than you. To tell yourself that every second not spent doing your work, or working on yourself, is a waste of your gift. To insist, I will not be demeaned like this. Once we fight this emotional and egotistical impulse, the canvas strategy is easy. The iterations are endless.

When someone doesn’t reckon you with the seriousness that you’d like, the impulse is to correct them. (As we all wish to say: Do you know who I am?!) You want to remind them of what they’ve forgotten; your ego screams for you to indulge it. Instead, you must do nothing. Take it. Eat it until you’re sick. Endure it. Quietly brush it off and work harder. Play the game. Ignore the noise; for the love of God, do not let it distract you. Restraint is a difficult skill but a critical one. You will often be tempted, you will probably even be overcome. No one is perfect with it, but try we must.

There is another story of Marshall sitting for one of the many official portraits that was required of him. After appearing many times and patiently honoring the requests, Marshall was finally informed by the painter that he was finished and free to go. Marshall stood up and began to leave. “Don’t you want to see the painting?” the artist asked. “No, thank you,” Marshall said respectfully and left.

Endless ambition is easy; anyone can put their foot down hard on the gas. Complacency is easy too; it’s just a matter of taking that foot off the gas. We must avoid what the business strategist Jim Collins terms the “undisciplined pursuit of more,” as well as the complacency that comes with plaudits. To borrow from Aristotle again, what’s difficult is to apply the right amount of pressure, at the right time, in the right way, for the right period of time, in the right car, going in the right direction.

Your body also tells you about feelings of fear, anxiety, depression, excitement, or joy. Perhaps your stomach gets tense or your legs rubbery, or your chest tightens when you are frightened; maybe your skin tingles or your heart flutters when you are excited.

A client named Carl was exploring his Child’s sense of shame and fear, and shared this example of an inner dialogue, edited only to make it more concise: ADULT: I know that you are feeling very upset right now. What is upsetting you? CHILD: I’m afraid of losing Liz. ADULT: Why do you think you’re going to lose her? CHILD: I’ll never be enough for her. ADULT: Why do you believe you aren’t enough? CHILD: Because you keep telling me I don’t do things right. And you sound just like mom and dad reminding me of everything I didn’t get done that day. No matter how much I do, you keep telling me it wasn’t enough, I should have done more. ADULT: I guess I do sound like them when I say that stuff. No wonder you feel bad so much of the time. CHILD: Yeah, and Liz treats me nice. If she leaves me, then I won’t have anyone to treat me nice.

The man who stops drinking but does not create an inner connection that heals the old pain and shifts the belief system that caused his drinking is what Alcoholics Anonymous calls a “dry drunk.” He has stopped the outer behavior of drinking, but because on an inner level nothing has changed, nothing actually changes in his life or his relationships. He just learns other ways to fill his emptiness and numb the fear and pain.

unimportant. Therefore, if I let people in on who I am or if I am me, I will not be loved. 2. I am powerless over how I feel. Other people or outside events are responsible for making me happy or unhappy. Other people are responsible for my hurt, anger, guilt, or disappointment. I can’t help how I feel. My good feelings come primarily from others’ approval and my bad feelings from their disapproval. I do not have the power to make myself happy within myself, or to take care of myself in the world. I have to rely on other people, things, or substances to make me happy or take care of me. I am a victim. 3. Other people’s feelings are more important than mine, and I am responsible for their feelings. When others feel hurt, disappointed, or upset because of something I’ve done (with no intent to hurt them), I’m wrong and it’s my fault, and I deserve the guilt I feel.

I can control what others think of me, feel about me, and how they treat me. I can “make” them like me or love me or be open to me by being good, nice, or open. Or I can “make” them treat me how I want to be treated by getting angry, righteous, and blaming. 5. Resisting others’ control over me is essential to my integrity. As soon as someone wants something from me, I have to do the opposite, even if it’s something I want to do or give, or I will lose myself to that other person. 6. I can’t handle pain, discomfort, fear, hurt, grief, disconnection from others, boredom, disappointment, shame, or aloneness.

The unloved, abandoned Inner Child, feeling so alone within and lonely in the world, numbs out the pain and fills the emptiness with addictive and codependent behavior, which fall into four different categories: (1) All the ways we deaden ourselves and fill ourselves up from the outside; (2) all the ways we overtly attempt to control another person; (3) all the ways we covertly attempt to control another person; (4) all the ways we resist being controlled by another person or by society.

Addictions to Substances, Things, Activities, and People To fill the emptiness and numb the pain, the Child becomes addicted to substances—food, sugar, cigarettes, caffeine, drugs, alcohol; to processes, things, and activities—TV, work, reading, sports, exercise, power, gambling, shopping, money, spending, sleep, shoplifting, ruminating, worry, misery, talking, meditation, talking on the telephone, drama, danger, glamor, religion; and to people—relationships, sex, romance, love, approval. The Child, without a loving Adult to define his or her worth, becomes ‘dependent on others’ love and approval for a sense of worth. An unloved Inner Child is always codependent, because the Inner Adult has abdicated the job of defining self-worth. The original parental abandonment and the resulting inner abandonment and intense need for outside approval leads to deep fears of being rejected, abandoned, controlled, and engulfed by others. These fears lead to controlling and resistant behavior, which in turn lead to dysfunctional marriages and dysfunctional families, and on and on in a

I had been reading the book on sexual abuse that you suggested I read, and I was becoming aware of some things that had happened to me as a child that I had brushed aside as unimportant. I was crying when I walked into the bedroom. Roger was there and asked me what was wrong. I told him I was upset by what I was remembering, so he came and put his arm around me. But it didn’t feel comforting, and I can’t figure out why. This has happened so often with him and I don’t understand what I’m feeling. MARGIE: What was his energy like when he put his arm around you? Did he seem to be centered and coming from a loving Adult, or did he feel weak and empty? PATTI: Oh, definitely weak and empty. He had a sort of sad little-boy look on his face, but at the same time was acting caring. MARGIE: So what did you experience as the underlying message of his action?

I didn’t believe he would be there for me if I didn’t give him what he wanted. I was afraid that if I said, “That doesn’t feel good,” he’d get upset with me, that he didn’t really want to understand what I was feeling. God! It’s just like I felt as a kid! My father would hold me and kiss me in inappropriate ways, but if I tried to push him away he would get so hurt that I would feel guilty. That’s just what I felt with Roger—that if I pushed him away, he would get hurt or angry instead of wanting to understand, and then I would feel guilty for hurting him. That makes me feel so trapped. MARGIE: It sounds like you gave yourself up and let him “comfort” you rather than face your fears about his unloving response to you and the guilt that you feel. If so, isn’t that a way you are trying to control his reaction to you?

The people with too much empathy are generally not in touch with what they feel because they lack any healthy narcissism. They are too focused on the other person’s feelings and ready at a moment’s notice to take responsibility for the other person. In other words, they are dedicated to caretaking—taking care of the other’s Inner Child and ignoring their own. As a result of this choice, they very quickly lose all sense of self in a relationship.

An unloving Adult/Parent’s behavior generally falls into two categories: authoritarian and permissive. When the Adult is being authoritarian, it criticizes, judges, shames, controls, and discounts the Inner Child. In terms of a person’s behavior, this means that when you feel afraid, you’re very likely to tell yourself to stop being cowardly, weak, and so on. When you fail, you’re likely to harass yourself for it: “How could I be so stupid! I’m always making a mess of things.” Or,

My response is that they need to stop focusing on “getting” their child to be different and start focusing on how they are not taking care of themselves. What are they role-modeling? Are they teaching codependence by taking responsibility for their children’s feelings, successes, and failures, and by making their children responsible for the parent’s feelings of anger, frustration, or aloneness?

She learned to say loving words to her Inner Child, like: “I know that this pain and fear you feel is the pain of feeling all alone and the fear that you can’t make yourself happy. I know that this is an old feeling, a feeling you had lots of times as a little girl, when you couldn’t take care of yourself and make yourself happy. But now I’m here, and I will take care of you. If you need someone to help with these feelings, I will find that help. If you need to be around other people, I will reach out to them. If you need to cry, that’s okay, I’m here for you to understand your feelings.

When your grandmother was five months pregnant with your mother, the precursor cell of the egg you developed from was already present in your mother’s ovaries.

Biological Psychiatry, examined the relationship between prenatal stress and its effects on the neurodevelopment of infants. The researchers measured the stress-regulating hormone cortisol in the amniotic fluid of 125 pregnant mothers to determine stress levels. The findings demonstrated that babies exposed to increased cortisol in utero, as early as seventeen weeks after conception, exhibited impaired cognitive development when they were evaluated at seventeen months old.8

imagine this scenario: A month before your mother is born, your grandmother receives the devastating news that her husband has been killed in an accident. With a new baby to prepare for, and little space to grieve the loss, your grandmother would likely submerge her emotions into the body she now shares with her daughter and grandchild. You and your mother would know something about that grief from a place deep inside you, a place all three of you share. It’s within this shared environment that stress can cause changes to our DNA. In the next section, we’ll look at how our genes are affected by traumas in our family history.

The historic study conducted by Yehuda in 2005 brought considerable awareness to the idea that stress patterns do, in fact, transfer from pregnant women to their children. Pregnant women (in their second or third trimester) who were either at or near the World Trade Center during the 9/11 attacks in New York City, and who went on to develop PTSD, delivered children who had low levels of cortisol.36 Their children also exhibited increased distress in response to new stimuli.

When a mother carries inherited trauma, or has experienced a break in the bond with her mother, it can affect the tender bond that’s forming with her infant, and that bond is more likely to be interrupted. The impact of an early break in the mother-child bond—an extended hospital stay, an ill-timed vacation, a long-term separation—can be devastating for the infant.

It experiences a physical and psychological withdrawal . . . not unlike the plight of a heroin addict who goes cold turkey.”2 This analogy helps to explain why all newborn mammals, including humans, protest with such vigor when they’re separated from their mothers.

When any machine, good or bad, is in the servitude of an evil master (at 1 in the diagram above), a dystopia will arise when the machineâ€™s superintelligence is directed to doing evil. At 2, any machine, good or bad, serving any master, good or evil, will be instructed to compete against other machines, leading to a mild dystopia that results from escalating competition and conflict between those machines as they attempt to meet the expectations set forth by their masters. Even good machines serving good masters at 3 will suffer from an inability to understand with full clarity what is expected from them, and if the machines are coded badly, as at 4, it does not matter who they serve, bugs and mistakes will hurt all of us.

Inflammation in the body—chronic joint pain, infections, inflammatory bowel disease, or an unmanaged autoimmune condition—releases immune messengers called cytokines. These cytokines send messages across the blood-brain barrier that activate inflammation in the brain, which alters brain function and destroys brain tissue.1

Newer research, however, shows the complex interplay between microglia and hormones, cytokines, neurotransmitters, and other chemical messengers in the body and brain. There are 10 glia cells for every neuron in the brain, and if you weigh the brain, more than 50 percent of it is glia cells. In other words the brain is more glia cells than neurons.

Take 800–1,000 mg of GABA and give yourself a two-to-three hour window to see whether it affects you. It is best to take GABA between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m., so you can sleep it off if it sedates you. If GABA causes relaxation, calming, and sedation, don’t keep taking it regularly or you risk shutting your GABA receptor sites and a retest won’t be accurate. If the GABA causes anxiety, irritability, or panic this also indicates a permeable blood-brain barrier (for reasons explained in the neurotransmitter section). Eating some protein may help alleviate these symptoms. Feeling no change after taking GABA is a good sign your blood-brain barrier is intact. GABA should produce no symptoms as GABA “bounces off” a healthy blood-brain barrier.

The best way to use these compounds is to start with a small dose and increase it slowly until the desired outcome is reached. The more symptomatic you are, the easier it will be to identify the correct dosage. For example, if you take 200 mg a day of curcumin and do not notice any impact on your inflammation-based depression, brain fog, or poor mental endurance, you may notice significant improvement at 2,000 mg a day. In those who have no noticeable symptoms, there is no way to determine the correct dosage, but 100–500 mg of each flavonoid may be good as a preventive strategy.

The biggest clue your blood glucose levels are stable is that you have an appetite at meal times (not just cravings for simple sugars) and when you eat there is no change in your energy levels. Feeling either tired or energized after you eat indicates your blood glucose levels are too high (insulin resistance) or too low (functional hypoglycemia), respectively. You should have no change in energy levels after meals; you should just no longer be hungry.

The hippocampus, the part of the brain associated with forming, organizing, and storing memories, has not fully developed its connections to the prefrontal cortex (the part of the brain that helps us interpret our experiences) until sometime after the age of two. As a result, the trauma of an early separation would be stored as fragments of physical sensations, images, and emotions, rather than as clear memories that can be pieced into a story. Without the story, the emotions and sensations can be difficult to understand.

When you consider doing something that you truly love and are invested in, you are going to feel an influx of fear and pain, mostly because it will involve being vulnerable. Bad feelings should not always be interpreted as deterrents. They are also indicators that you are doing something frightening and worthwhile.

Feeling “lost” or directionless. Feeling lost is actually a sign you’re becoming more present in your life—you’re living less within the narratives and ideas that you premeditated and more in the moment at hand. Until you’re used to this, it will feel as though you’re off-track (you aren’t).

Have you ever felt joy for more than a few minutes? What about anger? No? How about tension, depression, and sadness? Those have lasted longer, haven’t they? Weeks and months and years at a time, right? That’s because those aren’t feelings. They are symptoms. But we’ll get to their causes in a minute. What you have to know is that suffering is just the refusal to accept what is. That’s it. Etymologically, it comes from the Latin word to “from below to bear.” Or, to “resist, endure, put under.” So healing is really just letting yourself feel.

assimilate to the needs of other people’s egos. In the meantime, a world and lifetime of listening, leaning, allowing, following, perceiving, feeling, and experiencing…constantly eludes you. Sadness will not kill you. Depression won’t, either. But fighting it will. Ignoring it will. Trying to escape it rather than confront it will. Denying it will. Suffocating it will. Allowing it no place to go other than your deep subconscious to embed and control you will. Not that you’ll take your life or destroy everything “good” you do receive (though you might). But it will kill you in that it will rob you of every bit of life you do have: You either let yourself feel everything or numb yourself into feeling nothing. You cannot select emotions. You are either in accord with their flow or in resistance to their nature. In the end, the choice is yours.

our mother reflects our experiences back to us in doses we can ingest and assimilate. In an ideal world, when we cry, her face shows concern. When we laugh, she beams with delight, mirroring our every expression. When our mother is in tune with us, she infuses us with a sense of safety, worth, and belonging through the tenderness of her touch, the warmth of her skin, the constancy of her attention, and even the sweetness of her smile. She fills us up with all her “good stuff” and, in response, we develop a reservoir of “good feeling” inside.

During gestation, infancy, and early childhood, our brain is not equipped to put our experiences into story form so that they can be made into memories.

You reject, judge, or blame a parent. The emotions, traits, and behaviors you reject in a parent are likely to live on unconsciously in you. You might project the complaints you have about that parent onto your partner. You might also attract a partner who embodies qualities similar to those of the rejected parent. When you reject a parent, you might balance this rejection by struggling in your relationships. You might leave your partners or experience being left by them. Your relationships might feel empty, or you might opt to stay alone. A close bond with the same-sexed parent appears to strengthen our capacity to commit to a partner.

The one who wonders not only does not know, he is intimately sure that he does not know, and he understands himself as being in a position of not‑knowing. But this un‑knowing is not the kind that brings resignation. The one who wonders is one who sets out on a journey, and this journey goes along with the wonder: not only that he stops short for a moment, and is silent, but also that he persists in searching. – Joseph Pieper

There’s a phrase in Chinese, “wu wei,” that describes how I felt. In English, its translation is “non-doing,” but not in the sense of doing nothing. Non-doing is not about escaping anything or being lazy but instead refers to a deep level of connectedness with the world. The Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu wrote about this more than 2,500 years ago in the Tao Te Ching: “Less and less do you need to force things until finally you arrive at non‑action. When nothing is done, nothing is left undone. True mastery can be gained by letting things go their own way. It can’t be gained by interfering.”78 More recently, John Steinbeck channeled this sentiment in a letter to his son, telling him, “If it is right, it happens—The main thing is not to hurry. Nothing good gets away.”79

Introspection means talking to yourself, and one of the best ways of talking to yourself is by talking to another person. One other person you can trust, one other person to whom you can unfold your soul. One other person you feel safe enough with to allow you to acknowledge things—to acknowledge things to yourself—that you otherwise can’t. Doubts you aren’t supposed to have, questions you aren’t supposed to ask. Feelings or opinions that would get you laughed at by the group or reprimanded by the authorities.

I became more optimistic not because I started to write better or was right, but because I stopped hiding. I led with my curiosity, vulnerability, and passion and it immediately attracted the kind of people I wanted to meet. In the early 1900s, professor and writer Bertrand Russell noted that “any person who visits the Universities of the Western world is liable to be struck by the fact that the intelligent young of the present day are cynical to a far greater extent than was the case formerly.”149 He argued that developing a cynical stance was necessary in a world in which much of what authorities and leaders claim directly contrasts with what is true. The cure for such cynicism, he said, would “only come when intellectuals can find a career that embodies their creative impulses.”150

For example, instead of asking what makes up an amazing life, we first define the worst‑case scenario and then work backward. What does a miserable life entail? What actions would make achieving such a life more likely? Then figure out how you can avoid these things from becoming true. During my time on the default path, I often imagined a future version of myself that I knew I didn’t want to be: an overweight guy in his 50s who barely tolerates the people in his life, hates his job, spends his days in a windowless cubicle farm, and isn’t very happy. If you had known me then, you would have said I would never have ended up like that. However, by the time I left my job I was much closer to that person than when

Whereas money today embodies the principle, “More for me is less for you,” in a gift economy, more for you is also more for me because those who have, give to those who need it. Gifts cement the mystical realization of participation in something greater than oneself which, yet, is not separate from oneself. The axioms of rational self-interest change because the self has expanded to include something of the other.

I stopped renting. I started buying. I bought a house on a hill. I bought cars. I invested in stocks and built a portfolio. I was cranked to a fifth gear, and everything I did, I did on a deadline. I exercised like a demon. I drove my car at breakneck speed. I made more money than I had ever figured to see. I met a dark‑haired woman named Janine who somehow loved me despite my schedule and the constant absences. We married after a seven‑year courtship. I was back to work a week after the wedding. I told her – and myself – that we would one day start a family, something she wanted very much. But that day never came. Instead, I buried myself in accomplishments, because with accomplishments, I believed I could control things, I could squeeze in every last piece of happiness before I got sick and died, like my uncle before me, which I figured was my natural fate.

“Dying,” Morrie suddenly said, “is only one thing to be sad over, Mitch. Living unhappily is something else. So many of the people who come to visit me are unhappy.” Why? “Well, for one thing, the culture we have does not make people feel good about themselves. We’re teaching the wrong things. And you have to be strong enough to say if the culture doesn’t work, don’t buy it. Create your own.”

Morrie, true to these words, had developed his own culture – long before he got sick. Discussion groups, walks with friends, dancing to his music in the Harvard Square church. He started a project called Greenhouse, where poor people could receive mental health services. He read books to find new ideas for his classes, visited with colleagues, kept up with old students, wrote letters to distant friends. He took more time eating and looking at nature and wasted no time in front of TV sitcoms or “Movies of the Week.” He had created a cocoon of human activities – conversation, interaction, affection – and it filled his life like an overflowing soup bowl.174

To create your own culture on the pathless path you must identify the assumptions you make in your approach to life. Here are some of my assumptions, many of which have been sprinkled throughout this book: Many people are capable of more than they believe. Creativity is a real path to optimism, meaning, and connection. We don’t need permission to engage with the world and people around us. We are all creative, and it takes some people longer to figure that out. Leisure, or active contemplation, is one of the most important things in life, There are many ways to make money, and when an obvious path emerges, there is often a more interesting path not showing itself. Finding the work that matters to us is the real work of our lives.

pathless path is about opening yourself up to this emergence. It’s about growing up and letting go. It’s about realizing that if I claim to care about something, I need to be willing to act, and also be willing to be wrong. I must let go of my ego and my need to be seen as a “successful” person. I still feel lost in the sense that I don’t know what form my path will take in the future and what publishing this book means for my life. Those thoughts are scary and exciting. I wouldn’t have it any other way. My life won’t look exactly like Morrie’s, but I hope that I can channel the spirit of his wisdom. It’s rare to find someone at the end of their life that is still so energized and excited about life. I hope I can make it there in that state too.

Whether we end up with higher-quality content or not, the BATs model seems like an intrinsically fairer way to price user attention than the existing one, since it directly rewards the attention givers. Users earn tokens for choosing to look at an ad, and if demand for BATs-priced ads expands, those tokens will rise in value as more and more advertisers enter the market, providing a capital gain to users. This is a better alignment of results than the current system, built as it is on the conceit that we get wanted content for “free” in return for viewing ads, when in fact we are giving up both time and large amounts of valuable data about ourselves and our Internet surfing habits.

Whereas any two consenting parties can exchange a mainstream currency such as the dollar anywhere and for any transaction, a crypto-token contains software logic that can limit and proscribe what it’s used for. In Brave’s case, ads within its ecosystem can only be paid for with BATs. Other models include that of the decentralized computer storage platform Storj, which allows hard-drive-starved users to access others’ excess space in exchange for storj tokens.

The idea is that if Brave is successful, the BATs’ price will rise, which will in turn encourage more and more people to join the community and abide by its good-behavior-inducing rules. It aims for a network effect, one that feeds a virtuous circle of better-aligned incentives and rewards within the online content market.

“But with a token, it can be disbursed to users without credit consequences,” he adds, arguing that by contrast to a dollar’s worth of equity or debt, “the BAT is a social credit currency; it doesn’t have this inflationary property.” Let’s break that last comment down. The cost, for what it’s worth, of distributing the token to new users is borne by existing token holders, who will see their proportional stakes in the total supply diluted. But if, as Brave intends, this distribution successfully encourages network effects of expanding usage, a more-than-offsetting rise in token value may also occur. The point is that it’s all on the community—the society of BATs users—not on external investors, to bear the risk of that happening. That’s what Eich means by a social credit.

Layer 1: An ancient part of the brain, at its base, found in species from humans to geckos. This layer mediates automatic, regulatory functions. If body temperature drops, this brain region senses it and commands muscles to shiver. If blood glucose levels plummet, that’s sensed here, generating hunger. If an injury occurs, a different loop initiates a stress response. Layer 2: A more recently evolved region that has expanded in mammals. MacLean conceptualized this layer as being about emotions, somewhat of a mammalian invention. If you see something gruesome and terrifying, this layer sends commands down to ancient layer 1, making you shiver with emotion. If you’re feeling sadly unloved, regions here prompt layer 1 to generate a craving for comfort food. If you’re a rodent and smell a cat, neurons here cause layer 1 to initiate a stress response. Layer 3: The recently evolved layer of neocortex sitting on the upper surface of the brain. Proportionately, primates devote more of their brain to this layer than do other species. Cognition, memory storage, sensory processing, abstractions, philosophy, navel contemplation. Read a scary passage of a book, and layer 3 signals layer 2 to make you feel frightened, prompting layer 1 to initiate shivering. See an ad for Oreos and feel a craving—layer 3 influences layers 2 and 1. Contemplate the fact that loved ones won’t live forever, or kids in refugee camps, or how the Na’vis’ home tree was destroyed by those jerk humans in Avatar (despite the fact that, wait, Na’vi aren’t real!), and layer 3 pulls layers 2 and 1 into the picture, and you feel sad and have the same sort of stress response that you’d have if you were fleeing a lion.

Seen from this point of view, the mental reactions of the inmates of a concentration camp must seem more to us than the mere expression of certain physical and sociological conditions. Even though conditions such as lack of sleep, insufficient food and various mental stresses may suggest that the inmates were bound to react in certain ways, in the final analysis it becomes clear that the sort of person the prisoner became was the result of an inner decision, and not the result of camp influences alone.

In the first ashram, Brahmacharya, we prepare for love. We don’t get in a car and start to drive without studying for a learner’s permit and practicing the core skills in a safe space. When we take a new job, we might prepare by learning a new computer program, talking to people we’ll be working with about what might be expected of us, or reviewing whatever skills we might need. And we prepare for love by learning how to love ourselves in solitude. Alone, we learn to understand ourselves, to heal our own pain, and to care for ourselves.

The most common complaints I hear people make about their partners are, in essence, that they don’t do what they want them to do (“She doesn’t do her share of the household chores,” “He’s rude to my parents,” “They never give me compliments,” “He forgets my birthday”). But if you think your partner should do what you want when you want, I want to change how you look at your partner. That’s not a relationship, that’s ownership. Ownership is born of control.

Sometimes we are triggered because their behavior reminds us of something we worry about in our own life. We might fear that we aren’t succeeding in our career or purpose, and we’re projecting our own fear onto our partner.

If your partner is miserable and wants to quit their job, you might freak out and say, “You can’t do that! You know perfectly well that we can’t afford it!” When we do this, we are using fear and guilt to motivate them. Or we might swing in the opposite direction, saying what we think is the right thing to say without really meaning it. In this case we sometimes use hyper-motivational language like: “You’re a superstar! You can do anything you want! You can make this happen tomorrow.” But if you don’t believe this, it rings false.

In the Bhagavad Gita, the enemy (and ultimately the loser) is not a person but an ideology. It is darkness, ego, greed, and arrogance. In our relationship conflicts, the same is true. The loser shouldn’t be one of us. It should be the flawed ideology or issue and the negativity it provokes between us. What if we approached a fight as a team? The specter of disagreement builds like a wave in the ocean. As it approaches, it grows taller and more daunting. But instead of turning away from the wave to pretend you don’t see it, the two of you face it as it looms over you. Can you keep your heads above water, or will it crash on top of you? The key is understanding that your partner is not the wave. The wave is the issue about which you disagree. If the two of you approach it together, kicking in the same direction, encouraging each other, you can swim through it side by side with a sense of shared victory.

When my wife and I see ourselves as a team fighting against the problem, we crush the problem. The desire to win comes from ego, and we want to control our egos. Why would I want to crush my wife? Why do I want to defeat the person I’ve chosen to spend my life with? My wife is not my opponent—I love her. I don’t want her to lose. I don’t want to lose either.

We want to understand. We know why we’re having the argument, and we see resolving it as a healthy step in our relationship.

A couple is getting married. They can only invite a limited number of people, and each of their mothers has asked to reserve the last two available seats at the dinner for friends of hers. One groom wants to give the seats to his mother’s friends, and the other groom wants to accommodate his own mother. Each argues on behalf of their parent—saying how important and close these friends are and why they deserve the seats at the reception. This is a social conflict, brought about by both people wanting to fulfill their mother’s expectations. Then the argument shifts. One person says their family has put more money into the wedding and therefore they should get to decide. The other person says they’ve worked much harder on the planning, so they should choose. The accusations and arguments now have nothing to do with the parents—this has become a power struggle between the couple. An interpersonal conflict. But then the couple takes a break. Tempers calm, and they are ready to fight the issue instead of each other. When they return to the issue, they realize that neither of them wanted to let their mothers down. This was, for each of them, an inner conflict. The inner conflict is the one they truly needed to solve. At least one mother was going to be let down. They were arguing with each other instead of confronting their mothers.

Radhi and I have completely different styles of arguing. I want to dive in and talk it out, whereas she wants to collect her thoughts and cool down a bit before we speak. I’m eager to find a resolution, while she wants to take a break, decompress, and think through the issue on her own before reconvening. Understanding this about each other stopped me from feeling hurt when she would go quiet during an argument, and it stopped her from being annoyed when I would want to discuss an issue at length. Identifying your partner’s fight style and your own is the first step toward fighting for love.

couples arguing right after they get home from work. Everyone’s had a long day; no one knows what’s for dinner or has had time to decompress; and suddenly you’re arguing over who forgot to pay a bill. Ostrander says the 5:30 fight can often be avoided with a new routine: a quick check-in, maybe a hug and a kiss, then a short separation so each person can transition from work mode. Then, when you’ve both caught your breath, you can come back together in a more open and relaxed mental and emotional space.

Repeating activities may feel comfortable and relaxing, but you don’t learn anything new about your partner through familiar routines. On the other hand, if you’re growing, you can help your partnership grow. Intimacy develops and thrives when we disclose more, when we try out ideas and let ourselves be vulnerable.

Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather he must recognize that it is he who is asked. In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible. Thus,

I have termed this constitutive characteristic “the self-transcendence of human existence.” It denotes the fact that being human always points, and is directed, to something, or someone, other than oneself—be it a meaning to fulfill or another human being to encounter. The more one forgets himself—by giving himself to a cause to serve or another person to love—the more human he is and the more he actualizes himself.

This excessive intention, or “hyper-intention,” as I call it, can be observed particularly in cases of sexual neurosis. The more a man tries to demonstrate his sexual potency or a woman her ability to experience orgasm, the less they are able to succeed. Pleasure is, and must remain, a side-effect or by-product, and is destroyed and spoiled to the degree to which it is made a goal in itself.

There are a number of reasons why a founder might choose to go solo. For instance, the founder may already have many of the resources needed to found the startup, or there may be little need for the startup to grow quickly. The startup may not be expected to grow big enough to support multiple founders. The founder may want to keep all the equity and control of all decision making,

The founder may also be tempted to keep things simple in the early stages and thus dodge the coordination problems that come with bringing cofounders on board. Here, the founder’s instinct (or prior experience) is backed up by Arthur Stinchcombe’s groundbreaking article on what makes new organizations especially prone to failure.1 Three of the four factors he identified were repercussions of forming a founding team: cofounders were often challenged—and often undone—by the need to (a) learn new roles within the founding team, (b) negotiate the distribution of economic rewards among themselves, and (c) form trusting relationships with strangers (i.e., each other).

Once the core founder has decided to add cofounders, he or she has to decide how many cofounders to add. Each new cofounder increases coordination costs and inefficiency. As highlighted by Stinchcombe, the larger the team, the greater the coordination costs and the higher the risk that roles will overlap and cause conflict within the team.

In contrast, putting off the split for several months or more can give the cofounders a chance to learn whose skills and connections will contribute the most to the startup, how those contributions change as the startup’s strategy and business model change, how well each founder gets along with the others, how committed each founder is to the startup, and more.

In each case, the two cofounders discovered that early on, the demands of the startup made it more natural to adopt overlapping roles and collective decision making. This required an adjustment from their prior hierarchical relationships. However, as the startup grew and required a hierarchical structure, the cofounders’ hierarchical roots enabled them to make that transition more smoothly.

When you hire senior people in larger companies, they’re successful because they can manage a team. They won’t necessarily be effective on an individual level. I realized that in an early-stage company, there’s no such thing as a manager. Everyone is a contributor, including the CEO! People in mid-management and upper-management in large companies, when they have to go back five or six years to find a project they were proud of contributing to, that’s a red flag.”

The benefits of hiring experienced people include the following: • Skills, contacts, and credibility—Experienced hires are more likely to bring human and social capital to the startup and to provide it with reputational advantages. • Hiring leverage—By hiring experienced people, then delegating to them the task of hiring their own employees, founders can both leverage their own time and foster cohesion within each department in the startup. For example, one of the main reasons Frank Addante hired experienced people at Zondigo was because he “looked forward to relying on them to hire the people who would be working under them” and thus free Frank to pursue fund-raising.

Stability: Mr. Right versus Mr. Right Now—Experienced hires lower the probability of having to upgrade the team in the long run; their relevant experience usually helps them scale more smoothly with the growing organization. If a startup can attract a Mr. Right, who will be able to excel in the position through multiple stages of growth, rather than a Mr. Right Now, who can do the job now but will be out of his or her depth in the next stage of growth, that will save the startup a lot of trouble and disruption.

Cultural control—With bottom-up hiring, founders will be more in control of the culture they want to create. People lacking years of experience at established companies do not have such strong expectations of how a company should run and so are more open to the founder’s blueprint.18 James Milmo wanted his technology startup, Lynx, to be a home for creative “Renaissance” people; that is, people with high intelligence, creativity, and wide-ranging interests, but not necessarily with formal training in computer programming. James explained, “We hired a lot of Renaissance people who had backgrounds that were unrelated to what they would be doing for us. . . . Our culture was such that we got along with each other, spent a lot of time outside work together. We were a community. . . . People were more excited to be at Lynx because they loved who they worked with.” A startup hires inexperienced people hoping they will prove to be “rising stars” who can master new skills and grow into their roles. In contrast, experienced hires are expected to be “rock stars” who can contribute a lot of value right from the beginning. Genevieve Thiers, founder-CEO of Sittercity, explained how her ideas about hiring evolved throughout her startup: “[At first] I had brought in ‘rising stars’—young people who would be able to grow with the company. But they were simply too emotional about the business swings of the company. It took too much of my time and energy to manage them. I felt as though I needed to find more senior ‘rock stars’ to help me take the company to the next level.” She decided to focus more intensely on hiring a new executive team to replace those she had hoped would be rising stars and began searching for rock stars—people who were established and successful in their fields.
